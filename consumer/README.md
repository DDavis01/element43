EMDR-Consumer
=============

Ptython consumer for EMDR data feed

This requires redis-server, python-redis, hotqueue, zmq and pyzmq (with zmq.green extenstions).  Also requires EVE-Market-Data-Structures from Greg Taylor (https://github.com/gtaylor/EVE-Market-Data-Structures.git).

Many thanks to Greg Taylor for assistance, example code and for creating EMDR.
